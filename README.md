## YAML CV

This REPO contains my CV

I derive both my [wepage-CV](scheuclu.com/hugo_cv) as well as my PDF-CV from a common [YAML file](./data).
This reduces my workload a lot, and also makes it much easier to make changes.

## How to make changes
1. Edit the yaml file under [data](./data).
2. The webpage is automatically published on submit top Github.
3. The latex file need to be generated manually for now via [pdfgen/convert.py](pdfgen/convert.py). I want to automate this on submit in the future.
